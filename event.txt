					World Blood Donor Day 2022
					     14 June 2022


	World Blood Donor Day takes place on 14 June each year. The aim is to raise global awareness of the need for
	safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors
	make to national health systems. The day also provides an opportunity to call to action to governments and
	national health authorities to provide adequate resources and put into place systems and infrastructures to
	increase the collection of blood from voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors.
